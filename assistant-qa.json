            "text": "CONCEPT:<br><br>Section 1 embodies three foundational legal concepts:<br><br><strong>1. Nomenclature (Naming):</strong> Every statute must have an official short title for identification and citation in legal proceedings. This provides legal certainty and eliminates ambiguity.<br><br><strong>2. Territorial Jurisdiction:</strong> The extent clause defines where a law applies geographically. Special provisions recognize constitutional protections for tribal areas and special category states, balancing national uniformity with regional autonomy.<br><br><strong>3. Commencement:</strong> Laws don't automatically take effect upon passage. The commencement clause allows time for implementation, training, and awareness. This concept of 'appointed day' gives flexibility to the executive.<br><br>Together, these concepts establish the legal identity, scope, and timeline of the entire statute.<br><br><strong>EXAMPLES:</strong><br><br><strong>Example 1 - Nomenclature in Court:</strong><br>A lawyer files a bail application and cites 'Section 479, BNSS'. The judge immediately understands this refers to the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, not CrPC. The short title in Section 1(1) enables precise legal citation.<br><br><strong>Example 2 - Territorial Exemption:</strong><br>Police in Kohima, Nagaland arrest someone in June 2024. They cannot use provisions from Chapter V (about arrest procedures) because Section 1(2)(a) exempts Nagaland from most BNSS provisions. They continue using CrPC until the Nagaland Government issues a notification adopting BNSS.<br><br><strong>Example 3 - Commencement Date:</strong><br>A crime occurs on June 30, 2024 at 11:30 PM in Delhi. Investigation begins July 1, 2024. Per Section 1(3), BNSS came into force on July 1, 2024. Therefore, the investigation follows BNSS procedures, not CrPC (which was repealed), even though the crime occurred under the old law.<br><br><strong>Example 4 - State Notification:</strong><br>Nagaland Government decides to adopt BNSS provisions on community service (Chapter XI). They issue a notification under Section 1(2) applying only Chapter XI with modifications for local customs. Now community service provisions apply in Nagaland, but other BNSS chapters still don't.",

Similarly, Chapters 9, 11, 12 apply everywhere.<br><br><strong>Concept 4: State Government's Special Power</strong><br>The State Government has a special power - it can decide to use other parts of this law in Nagaland or tribal areas if it wants.<br>• <strong>Example:</strong> Like a principal can decide to apply certain school rules to the hostel too, the State Government can choose to apply BNSS rules to these areas.<br><br><strong>Concept 5: Official Notification Required</strong><br>To do this, the State Government must issue an official notification (a formal announcement).<br>• <strong>Example:</strong> Just like your school puts up a notice board announcement for new rules, the government must publish an official notification.<br><br><strong>Concept 6: Power to Make Local Modifications</strong><br>The State Government can make small changes to the law to fit local situations when applying it.<br>• <strong>Example:</strong> If a school rule says 'wear black shoes' but in a hilly area, the principal allows 'wear boots', similarly, the State can modify rules for local needs.<br><br><strong>Concept 7: Changes Must Be Documented</strong><br>These changes should be mentioned in the notification.<br>• <strong>Example:</strong> Like the principal must write 'boots allowed' in the notice, the government must write all changes in their notification.",
